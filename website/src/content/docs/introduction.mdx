Carve UI is a rugged and accessible headless component library for [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). Carve UI gives you powerful building blocks designed to be flexible, accessible, and enjoyable for developers. 

Whether you're prototyping a quick feature or building a complex UI, Carve UI lets you focus on creating experiences that are both visually appealing and inclusive, without the extra fluff.

    Carve UI is currently in early development. Expect breaking changes in minor releases until 1.0 is ready! We're actively working on new components and features, so stay tuned!

## What is Carve UI?

Carve UI is a collection of **headless component primitives** â€“ meaning each component provides essential functionality with [almost zero styles](/styling). You get full control over the appearance, letting you shape each component to fit your unique design and brand. 

All components are built with accessibility in mind, giving you peace of mind knowing your application is inclusive by default. Carve UI also leverages TypeScript for improved developer experience, ensuring a smooth, predictable workflow.

- **Headless**: Add your own styles and design while Carve UI handles the rest.
- **Accessible**: Functionality strives to follow [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
- **Lightweight**: No unnecessary styles or dependencies, keeping your bundle size small.
